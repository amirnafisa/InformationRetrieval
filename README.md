Task:
INPUT TO THE MODEL: Documents = <Foreign/English Language Documents>
INPUT TO THE MODEL: Query = <Foreign/English Language Query>

OUTPUT OF THE MODEL: Rank of documents for the query

EVALUATION: Supervised Dataset

MODEL: Supervised/Semisupervised learning

      2. Compare RNN vs Vector based models

DEPENDENCY:
      1. Dataset: CLIR JHU (Kevin Duh)
      2. Bilingual Dictionary: Wikipedia based
      
MODEL EITHER CASE:
      1. Base model (similar to assignments)
      2. Additional (compare RNN based and vector based models)
      3. compare semi-supervised and supervised learning evaluation
      4. Extending model for Tnc in another domain
      5.
